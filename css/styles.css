/* Navbar: Create a navbar that scrolls away together with the page
(the navbar should become invisible and is not fixed to the top when
you scroll the page down). The navbar should have a company name
(i.e., navbar-brand class) called "Food, LLC" that is aligned to
the left side of the navbar.
(See https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#navbar.
Make the browser window narrower to see the mobile menu button
appear in the first example shown at the provided link.)
